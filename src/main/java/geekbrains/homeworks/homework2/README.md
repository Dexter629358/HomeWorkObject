# Task

## Part 1

Create three classes:

- Person
- Cat
- Robot

Which are not inherited from the same class.

These classes should be able to:

- run
- jump

All with the output of information about the action to the console.

## Part 2

Create two classes:

- Treadmill
- Wall

When passing through which the participants must perform the appropriate actions
`run` or `jump`, the result of the execution is printed into the console (successfully
ran, could not run, etc.). Obstacles have a length of (for the track) or height
(for the wall), as well as restrictions on running and jumping.

## Part 3

Create two arrays: with participants and obstacles, and force all participants to
pass this set of obstacles. If the participant could not pass one of the obstacles,
then he does not go further down the list of obstacles.
