# Task

## Part 1

Create three classes:

- Person
- Cat
- Robot

Which are not inherited from the same class.

These classes should be able to:

- run
- jump

All with the output of information about the action to the console.

## Part 2

Create two classes:

- Treadmill
- Wall

When passing through which the participants must perform the appropriate actions
`run` or `jump`, the result of the execution is printed into the console (successfully
ran, could not run, etc.). Obstacles have a length of (for the track) or height
(for the wall), as well as restrictions on running and jumping.
