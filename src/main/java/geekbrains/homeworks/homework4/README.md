# Task

Use class `Calculator` from [lesson 4](../../lessons/lesson4/task3).

- Extend the `Calculator` class to multiplication.
- Extend the `Calculator` class by division.
- Expand the `Calculator` class to binary translation (accepted values are both string
  and int - here you need to think about how best to implement what will happen if
  rounded Double/Float (rounded -> with zero at the end of approx. 3.0, 4.0, etc.)
  are accepted))
