# Task 1

Create classes:

- Dog
- Cat
- Domestic Cat
- Tiger
- Animal

Animals can run and swim. The length of the obstacle is passed to each method as an
argument.

Each animal has restrictions on actions (running: cat — 200 m, dog — 500 m;
swimming: cat — can't swim, dog — 10 m).

The result of the action will be printing to the console.
For example: `dogBobik.run(150)`; -> `Bobik ran 150 m`.

Create one array with animals and make them take turns to run the distance and swim.

Add a count of created Pet Cats, Tigers, Dogs, Animals.
